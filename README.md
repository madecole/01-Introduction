# 01-Introduction

I wrote a Python program that displays answers to the following questions:

* What is your name?
* What is your favorite game?
* What concerns do you have about this class?
* What are you excited about (in general)?
* What is your stackoverflow.com user number?
* What is the URL to your github.com profile?

This program answers the questions mentioned above. I printed the questions above before answering them so that users could understand what question I was answering. I wanted to include user input to make the program somewhat interactible. I prompt for them to type in their name and make the code a little more personal. 
Each statement is made possible with the "print" command, and the user input is done by declaring a variable and then prompting for input to designate a meaning to that variable. 
In this code the variable is the user's name.
